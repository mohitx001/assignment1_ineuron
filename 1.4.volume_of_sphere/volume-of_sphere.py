# I made this program for diameter 12 . and also depend on user input:
k=12
d1=float(12/2)
a = float((4/3)*(3.14)*(d1)**3)
print("volume of sphere with diameter", k ,"is: ",a)


c = input("enter the diameter of sphere : ")
d=float(c)
r = float(d/2)
b = float((4/3)*(3.14)*(r)**3)
print("volume of sphere with diameter", c ,"is: ",b)
