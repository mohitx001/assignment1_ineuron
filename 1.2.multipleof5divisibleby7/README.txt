1.problem given:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple
of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a
comma-separated sequence on a single line.

2.output:

 Following are no. which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5

2030,2065,2100,2135,2170,2205,2240,2275,2310,2345,2380,2415,2450,2485,2520,2555,2590,2625,2660,2695,2730,2765,2800,2835,2870,2905,2940,2975,3010,3045,3080,3115,3150,3185


from  1201  numbers there are 34 numbers divisible by 7 and multiple of 5
